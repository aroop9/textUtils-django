Every few months we see pictures or videos of some animals in zoos which are clearly in distress.
It makes us really sad and angry and we run social media campaigns to free those animals or close
those zoos. There is no denying the fact that a badly managed zoo is the worst sort of place imaginable,
but even a nicely managed zoos still has cages and any person with a heart believes that animals shouldnâ€™t
be kept in cages but believe it or not zoos do have many benefits for the environment.
Zoos are a necessity in some cases so are they the lesser evils of the world of environmental management?
The debate about zoos being evil or a necessity has been going on for decades now, which is why we will
take a look at both the negative and positive aspects of zoos.
